# Python notebooks for data science
## The purpose of this repository is to be used as a beginner friendly source for people who are new to the data science world.
## In the long run, I will add different notebooks to try and cover all the basic tools needed to begin with.
## If you are into data science, machine/deep learning, computer vision or just want to expand your abilities with python, I'm sure that this repository and my contents will provide you with the necessary tools.
